Labyrinth

Small and simple web-based game, where you are trapped in the Labyrinth with Minotaurs and, maybe, other players. The Labyrinth has only one Exit, one Hospital (when you are getting to if you died) and some other features.

The main goal is to get out. Every player may move, shoot from his revolver (if there are some bullets) and use a knife. Knife may only make damage to other players, and Minotaurs can only be killed by shootong them.
